The most important visualizations were compiled into a Tableau Story. The first page includes an overall look at some key data, including the total number of riders and a breakdown by gender and user type. Additionally, I mapped

# Summary

A dataset as large as the one utilized here lends itself to a significant number of possible visualizations and analyses. The work above focuses on looking at the data through a gender perspective, but I created two additional visualiztions involving the types of user - subscribers and regular customers. I wanted to see if there was a difference in the stations that each used to start or stop their journey, assuming that customers might likely be tourists and subscribers would be residents and work commuters.

Looking at the map of customer starting locations, there appears to a higher number of starts around Central Park and close to the Hudson River. The second visualization helps to clarify this idea and looks specifically at the top ten most used starting locations. While subscribers use the Citi Bike program in much larger numbers than customers, the top three locations used by customers were relatively less used by subscribers, ranked 8th, 9th and 10th. 

Furthermore, the top three customer start locations can be found near parks, shopping and tourist attractions:
- 12th Ave and 40th St - next to the Hudson River at the ferry terminal and near museums
- Broadway and W 60th - Columbus Circle, at the edge of Central Park and a large mall
- West St and Chambers St - Rockafeller Park, near Battery Park sports fields and Tribeca
